# Contributions
Prior to receiving information from any contributor, Symantec requires that all contributors complete, sign, and submit Symantec Personal Contributor Agreement (SPCA). The purpose of the SPCA is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the project and thereby allow Symantec to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed SPCA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit privileges to the Symantec open source project. Please note that the privilege to commit to the project is conditional and may be revoked by Symantec.

If you are employed by a corporation, a Symantec Corporate Contributor Agreement (SCCA) is also required before you may contribute to the project. If you are employed by a company, you may have signed an employment agreement that assigns intellectual property ownership in certain of your ideas or code to your company. We require a SCCA to make sure that the intellectual property in your contribution is clearly contributed to the Symantec open source project, even if that intellectual property had previously been assigned by you.

Please complete the SPCA and, if required, the SCCA and return to Symantec at:
